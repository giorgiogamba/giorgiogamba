## Giorgio Gamba

I am a Software Engineer based in Turin, Italy. Currently, I am working as a Game Developer in 34BigThings, a very special studio <3

I love Computer Science in every aspect, that's why I try to study and improve as much as I can in every field. Some of my personal projects are
related to Game engines and development, AudioProgramming (I am building a complete VST Synthetizer using JUCE) and App development.
I always though about programming as a way to shape the world following my needs, that's why I use it to solve my real-life problems and ease it.
I have always been passionate about music, and thus I am connecting it to computers in order to blendmy two biggest passions in the best way.
I also love the more deep knowledge about languages and computers, like the wide and complex C++ use and parallel programming
