# Hi there!
I am Giorgio Gamba and I am a software engineer based in Turin, Italy. I love Computer Science in every aspect, that's why I try to study and improve as much as I can in every field.

Currently, I work at Leonardo Electronics for the ATOS project development. Here I use C++, Qt and the DDS standard to create new project features.

I have always thought programming is a way to shape the world following my needs, that's why I use it to solve my real-life problems and ease them. I also love the deepest knowledge about languages and computers, parallel programming and Artificial Intelligence. Computer Science is part of basically all my major hobbies and I am always trying to apply it to them, like for example creating a Discogs browser, a Game Engine or a VST Plugin.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects! ðŸ‘¯ Please contact me here on GitHub, send an email to giorgiogamba97@gmail.com or catch me on LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/giorgiogamba97.

Keep on coding! :D
